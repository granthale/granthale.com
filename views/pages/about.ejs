        <p class="lead mb-4">
          I graduated in May 2023 from UIUC with a major in finance and a minor
          in computer science. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">To those who say college is becoming outdated, I
          truly don't know where I would be without the people I met and
          the (main)character that I developed.
        </p>
        <h3 class="display-10 text-body-emphasis">Time & Location</h3>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          I've got  ~<span id="days"></span> days and counting until I
          start work for Boston Consulting Group as an Associate. Here is where I'll be from now until then:
          <ul class="lead mb-4">
            <li>May - Chicago</li>
            <li>June - Iceland, Amsterdam, Norway, Germany, Italy</li>
            <li>July - San Francisco</li>
            <li>August - San Francisco, Chicago</li>
            <li>September, October, November, December - TBD</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="display-10 text-body-emphasis">Energy</h3>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Here are the things that I'm
          currently putting energy into:
        </p>
        <ul class="lead mb-4">
          <li>Writing @ least 15 minutes a day - ideally closer to an hour</li>
          <li>
            Developing this website from scratch - it's been an awesome way to document
            where I'm currently at and the things that I'm excited about for the
            future
          </li>
          <li>
            Learning linear algebra to stay sharp and to hopefully apply to a fun side project
          </li>
          <li>Recording podcast episodes for Surface Tension with incredible people</li>
          <li>Travelling & experiencing different cultures</li>
          <li>Meeting people & developing closer relationships</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="lead mb-4"> I'm a major believer that cool things usually don't happen without other people. I'm always down to meet new people and work on new things!</p>
